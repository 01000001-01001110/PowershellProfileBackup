This is a tool I have worked at perfecting.

I also have a Gather Inventory function that grabs and consolidates the following information into one xlsx file: <br>
= PowerShell Drive<br>
= Logical Drives<br>
= Network Drives<br>
= Connected Drives<br>
= OSInfo<br>
= BIOS Settings<br>
= IPConfig<br>
= Local Admins<br>
= Comptuername<br>
= Firewalls<br>
= Application Events<br>
= System Events<br>
= Installed Apps<br>
= Process<br>
= Service<br>

I also use the cortana default voice to verbally queue you to what the script is doing as I have not figured out how to create jobs/runspaces yet. <br>
