# PowershellProfileBackup
Windows profile backup

This is a tool I have worked at perfecting.

Currently this backs up;
  Desktop
  Downloads
  Documents
  Videos
  Music
  Quick Parts
  Pictures
  Browsers (IE, Chrome, Firefox)
  OneDrive
  OneDrive Not sync'd yet files
  Custom Directory
  Adobe Security/Signature
  Outlook Signature
  Outlook Config Reg
  Outlook Settings
  Office Ribbon and QAT Settings
  
I also have a Gather Inventory function that grabs and consolidates the following information into one xlsx file: 
= PowerShell Drive
= Logical Drives
= Network Drives
= Connected Drives
= OSInfo
= BIOS Settings
= IPConfig
= Local Admins
= Comptuername
= Firewalls
= Application Events
= System Events
= Installed Apps
= Process
= Service

I also use the cortana default voice to verbally queue you to what the script is doing as I have not figured out how to create jobs/runspaces yet.
